# MyReads Project

## Project Overview
In the MyReads project, bookshelf app was created which allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## How to run the application
1. Clone the project: $ git clone https://github.com/caiqianlucy/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

2. To get started developing right away, in the terminal:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`



## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
